**Last Updated: September 2023**

## Introduction

Welcome to Persian Calendar. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide

Persian Calendar does not require you to create an account or provide any personal information to use the app.

### Information Collected Automatically

- **Local Storage**: The app stores your preferences, settings, and events you create locally on your device. This information is not transmitted to our servers or any third parties.

- **Notifications**: If you allow notifications, the app will request permission to send you local notifications for events you create. These notifications are processed entirely on your device and are not sent to our servers.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information stored locally on your device solely to:

- Display your calendar events and preferences
- Send you local notifications for events you've created (if you've granted permission)
- Improve the app's functionality based on your settings

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not share, sell, rent, or trade any information with third parties.

## Data Security

All your data is stored locally on your device. We do not collect or store your information on our servers.

## Your Rights

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over your information. You can:

- Delete events at any time
- Modify your preferences and settings
- Disable notifications through your device settings
- Uninstall the app, which will remove all app-related data from your device

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.

## Consent

By using our app, you consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its terms.

## Automatic Region-Based Prayer Time Calculation

The Persian Calendar app now includes an "Automatic (Recommended)" option for prayer time calculation. If you select this option, the app will use your device's location (if you grant permission) to automatically choose the most appropriate calculation method for your region. This ensures the most accurate prayer times for your location.

- **If you allow location access:** The app determines your country and selects the best calculation method (e.g., University of Tehran for Iran, ISNA for North America, MWL for Europe, etc.).
- **If you deny location access:** The app defaults to the University of Tehran method for prayer time calculation.
- **Your location data is used only on your device and is never sent to any server or third party.**

You can always manually select your preferred calculation method in the app settings. The automatic region-based logic is designed to enhance accuracy and user experience while fully respecting your privacy.
