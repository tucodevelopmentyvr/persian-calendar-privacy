# Privacy Policy for Persian Calendar

## Last Updated: April 2025

## Introduction

Welcome to Persian Calendar. We respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the app handles information. **Please note that this app stores all data exclusively on your local device. The developer does not collect, access, or transmit any of your data.**

## Information We Collect

**No Data Collection:** Persian Calendar **does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or usage data from your device.** All information, including your preferences, settings, and any events you create, is stored **solely and exclusively locally on your device.**

- **Local Storage**: The app utilizes your device's local storage for all its data needs, including preferences, settings, and user-created events. This information remains on your device and is never sent to us or any third party.
- **Location Data**: If you enable the prayer times feature, the app requires your device's location to calculate accurate prayer times. This location data is used only on your device and is never transmitted to our servers or any third parties. Prayer times are calculated directly on your device. The app is designed to request location access only once and then cache this information for future use to minimize battery usage and respect your privacy.
- **Notifications**: If you grant permission, the app uses your device's notification system to send local reminders for events you create and prayer times. These notifications are processed entirely on your device and involve no data transmission to external servers.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information stored locally on your device solely to:

- Display your calendar events and preferences
- Calculate prayer times based on your location (if the feature is enabled)
- Send you local notifications for events and prayer times (if you've granted permission)
- Display holidays and special occasions in the Persian calendar
- Show full weekday names in the Persian calendar

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

Since **we do not collect any data from you or your device**, there is no information to share, sell, rent, or trade with any third parties. Your data remains private and under your control on your device.

## Data Security

All your data, including settings, events, and location information used for prayer times, is stored **exclusively locally on your device.** The security of this data depends on the security measures you implement on your own device. **The developer has no access to this data and therefore cannot provide security for it.**

**All data created or managed by the Persian Calendar app is stored locally on your device. The developer does not have access to, control over, or responsibility for this data.**

**You, the user, are solely responsible for the management and security of the data stored on your device.** This includes backing up your data and securing your device.

**THE DEVELOPER DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY FOR ANY LOSS, DAMAGE, INJURY, OR CLAIM OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, ARISING FROM OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH:**
